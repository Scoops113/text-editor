# JATE Text Editor

## Description
JATE (Just Another Text Editor) is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for editing text. It provides offline functionality, allowing users to work without an internet connection, and it uses IndexedDB for data persistence. This project demonstrates the use of service workers, Webpack for bundling, and various web technologies to create a robust and responsive text editor.
